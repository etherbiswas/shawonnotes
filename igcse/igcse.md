# Welcome to IGCSE

Hi all,

I am finally updating Shawon Notes after leaving it idle for half a decade. I am rebuilding this website, so I can give everyone a better version and not the slow, ad-filled, difficult to edit and annoying to use old website. Shawon Notes is now completely ad-free and open-source, you can find it on [github](https://github.com/shawonibnkamal/shawonnotes). 

I am requesting everyone that are currently studying to help contribute to this project - it will be especially beneficial for aspiring computer science students who will get their hands on experience working with git and contributing to open-source repos.

There are many ways you can contribute:
- Report broken links under [issues](https://github.com/shawonibnkamal/shawonnotes/issues) tab in github.
- Update any misinformation in existing node and create a pull request against the github repo. (Feel free to contact me on how to do it.)
- Update past papers list.
- Update revision notes.
- Add links to relavant helpful resources.

Best of luck,

Shawon Ibn Kamal
