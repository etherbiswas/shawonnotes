Shawon Notes as the name suggests was created by Shawon during his O’Level and A’Level (2015 – 2017). He decided to upload the notes he wrote to prepare for his own exams but little did he know the website would grow so huge. Regardless, he is grateful for all the support he received and hopefully can give more of this in the future.
